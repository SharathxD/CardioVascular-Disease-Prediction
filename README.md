# CARDIO BUDDY 
is a software based on the machine learning classifier model, which provides a user friendly, interface that helps to predict individuals that are prone to CVD ( Cardio Vascular Disease ) , based on their laboratory report .
This software uses well-known and trusted machine learning models [ Support Vector 
Machine, K- Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Random Forest ] to give the accurate prediction on the lab reports .

Here we can predict individual person's data or we can upload a dataset and get the Patient Id's of individuals who are prone to CVD . 
When the individual person's data is used to predict the output is saved in a excel file which can be further used for more analysis.
